DESCRIPTION
-----------

This module provides the function "transliterate" for transliterating strings between any 8-bit character sets defined in RFC 1345 (Keld Simonsen, IETF, June 1992).  The RFC document is included so you can look up character set names and aliases (and it's also read by the module when creating transliteration maps).

The module also contains the function "build_substitutes" which recreates a file of approximate substitutions when a character in the FROM set isn't defined in the TO set.  For example, "Latin capital A" substitutes for "Latin capital A with ogonek" (the "little tail" on Polish nazalized A and E).  It takes a long time to rebuild the file, but you should never need to.
